# Human-Activity-Detection

This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking,
Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different
activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors
(accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label
the data manually.

How data was recorded : 
By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial
linear acceleration'(tAcc-XYZ) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (tGyro-XYZ) from
Gyroscope with several variations.
